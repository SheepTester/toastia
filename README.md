Inspired by [this Scratch game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10114095/), I want to make some game based on my real life friends.

Each person will rule or co-rule their own region, with special blocks etc etc. I'm not sure what the storyline will be; I'll decide that once I'm sure that I don't give up on the engine.
